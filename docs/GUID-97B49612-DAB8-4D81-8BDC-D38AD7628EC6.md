# ZCL_PutNextElement Function

## C

```c
ZCL_Status_t ZCL_PutNextElement(ZCL_NextElement_t *element);
```

## Description

 Adds an element to the outgoing command payload

This function is used to simplify forming a correst payload for general
commands (read/write attributes etc.). A single command may involve actions on
several attributes, and so the overall payload should contain pieces
corresponding to each attribute.

The general idea is to provide a buffer for the payload and some content. The
function writes the content in a correct way to the buffer and calculate the
overall payload length. The buffer and the payload length are then passed as
parameters to the ZCL_AttributeReq() function.

See the following example:

```c
ZCL_NextElement_t element;
ZCL_ReadAttributeReq_t readAttrReqElement;
ZCL_Request_t readAttrReq;
uint8_t buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

element.payloadLength = 0;
element.payload = buffer;
element.id = ZCL_READ_ATTRIBUTES_COMMAND_ID;
element.content = &readAttrReqElement;

readAttrReqElement = ATTRIBUTE_ID1; //Set to the ID of the first attribute
ZCL_PutNextElement(&element);

readAttrReqElement = ATTRIBUTE_ID2; //Set to the ID of the second attribute
ZCL_PutNextElement(&element);

readAttrReq.requestLength = element.payloadLength;
readAttrReq.requestPayload = buffer;
...
```

Note, however, that the usage may differ depending on a command's type.
