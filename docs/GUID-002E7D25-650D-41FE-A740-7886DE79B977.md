## Description
  The structure represents parameters of data request, i.e. the request for  sending data across the network. A pointer
  to an instance of the structure should to be passed as an argument to APS_DataReq() function
  The structure definition follows APSDE-DATA request primitive described in
  Zigbee Specification r18, 2.2.4.1.1 APSDE-DATA.request, page 23.
