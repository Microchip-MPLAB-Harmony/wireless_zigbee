## Description

 This command is generated by a Remote Device in response to an
 IEEE_addr_req command inquiring as to the 64-bit IEEE address of the Remote
 Device or the 64-bit IEEE address of an address held in a local discovery cache.
 The destination addressing on this command shall be unicast.
