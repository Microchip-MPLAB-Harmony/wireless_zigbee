## Description

Describes neighbor table entry Neighbor table is an essential object involved in many network-related stack operations. It is also used by a number of synchronous functions performing network control. The neighbor table is filled on the network start
procedure. The stack maintains the table updating it upon receiving various network requests such as Link status frames, leave requests, child joining and loss, etc.
