# ZDO_MatchDescReq_t Struct

## C

```c
typedef struct PACK
{
  /* NWK address for the request.*/
  ShortAddr_t nwkAddrOfInterest;
  /* Profile ID to be matched at the destination.*/
  ProfileId_t profileId;
  /* The number of Input Clusters provided for matching within the InClusterList.*/
  uint8_t     numInClusters;
  /* List of Input ClusterIDs to be used for matching; the InClusterList is the
  desired list to be matched by the Remote Device (the elements of the InClusterList
  are the supported output clusters of the Local Device).*/
  ClusterId_t inClusterList[MAX_REQUESTED_CLUSTER_NUMBER];
  /* The number of Output Clusters provided for matching within OutClusterList.*/
  uint8_t     numOutClusters;
  /* List of Output ClusterIDs to be used for matching; the OutClusterList is the
  desired list to be matched by the Remote Device (the elements of the OutClusterList
  are the supported input clusters of the Local Device).*/
  ClusterId_t outClusterList[MAX_REQUESTED_CLUSTER_NUMBER];
} ZDO_MatchDescReq_t;

```
## Description

 ZDO Match Descriptor request primitive allows to find remote devices
 supporting a specific simple descriptor match criterion
 Conforms to ZigBee spec r17 Table 2.50 page 105.
