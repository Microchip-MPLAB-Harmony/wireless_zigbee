# ZDO_SleepReq Function

## C

```c
void ZDO_SleepReq(ZDO_SleepReq_t *req);
```

## Description

 Puts the device into the sleep mode

The duration of the sleep period is determined by the -CS_END_DEVICE_SLEEP_PERIOD
parameter. If CS_END_DEVICE_SLEEP_PERIOD is 0 then the device
will sleep infinitely and could be waken up by a hardware interrupt only. Note that
CS_END_DEVICE_SLEEP_PERIOD is also used by the parent to track the state of
the child.

Accessed via the ZDO_SleepConf_t-status field of the ZDO_SleepReq_t:ZDO_SleepConf
callback's argument 


-ZDO_SUCCESS_STATUS (0x00) - operation has completed successfully and the node will

be put into the sleeping mode after the callback function returns 


-ZDO_BUSY_STATUS (0x04) - the ZDO component is processing a transaction, and turning

to the sleeping mode cannot be done
