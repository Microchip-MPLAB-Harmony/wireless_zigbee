# ZCL_SetReportableChange Function

## C

```c
ZCL_Status_t ZCL_SetReportableChange(Endpoint_t endpointId, ClusterId_t clusterId, uint8_t clusterSide, ZCL_AttributeId_t attrId, uint8_t attrType, uint8_t *repChange);
```

## Description

 Finds an attribute in ZCL and rewrites its reportable change value by the new one

\ingroup zcl_common

If the reportable change value of an attribute is set to a non-zero value, using
this function, the stack checks how much the attribute has changed each
time a new value is set to it. The current (just set) value is compared with
the last reported value, and if the absolute difference is greater than the
reportable change value a new report is generated and sent to the air.

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| endpointId | endpoint on which cluster is registered |
| clusterId | cluster unique identifier |
| clusterSide | determs the cluster's side (client or server) |
| attrId | attribute unique identifier |
| attrType | type of the attribute to be set |
| repChange | pointer to reportable change value to be set  

## Returns

 ZCL status of operation.
