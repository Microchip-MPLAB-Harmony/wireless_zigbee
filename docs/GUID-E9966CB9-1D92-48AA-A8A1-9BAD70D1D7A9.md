## Description


    struct APS_DataInd_t apsdeData.h "aps.h"
 
    The structure for indication of data reception
 
    A pointer to an instance of this type is passed to a data indication callback registered for a given
    endpoint when the data is received destined to the endpoint.
    The structure definition follows APSDE-DATA indication primitive described in
    Zigbee Specification r18, 2.2.4.1.3 APSDE-DATA.indication, page 29.
