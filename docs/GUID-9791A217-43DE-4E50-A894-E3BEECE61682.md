# ZDO_StopSyncReq Function

## C

```c
ZDO_Status_t ZDO_StopSyncReq(void);
```

## Description

 Stops sending sync requests (polling the parent)

The function turns off auto polling mechanism. The stack stops sending polling
requests to the parent automatically. So if the parent node receives data frames
for the node when the node is sleeping, the node will not automatically request
for those data frames stored by its parent. In this case synchronization with the
parent can be done manually by sending NWK_SyncReq(). This can be useful if the
application does dot want a node to perform any actions after it wakes up and wants
to control fully data flow to end devices.

The function should be used only on end devices which are able to sleep and with

-CS_RX_ON_WHEN_IDLE set to false. The latter implies that radio is being switched on

only for a certain period of time when the stack sends data and waits for a reply.

## Parameters

 None 

## Returns

*ZDO_SUCCESS_STATUS (0x00)* - operation completed successfully

*ZDO_INVALID_REQUEST_STATUS (0x80)* - sync requests are already stopped
