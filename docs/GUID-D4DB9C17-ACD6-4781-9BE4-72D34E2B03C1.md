## C

```c
void ZDO_MgmtNwkUpdateNotf(ZDO_MgmtNwkUpdateNotf_t * nwkParams);
```

## Description

 Indicates network parameters update.

The function shall be implemented by the application. It is called by the stack to signal
certain network-related updates. The argument's fields contain indication of the event which
caused the update (see possible values of ZDO_MgmtNwkUpdateNotf_t-status  field) as well as
additional information concerned with the update. Example cases when the function is called
include changing of network parameters, resolving address/PANID conflict, rejoining the network,
attaching new child and child loss.

Child loss notification is issued only in the case of the end device child. A router
is not considered a child after its parent receives the first Link status frame from the
router. From that moment no notification is issued on the router's parent in case the router
leaves the network. But if the parent has not yet received any Link status frames from its
router child and the router leaves, the notification is raised on the parent as usual.

Notification statuses:
Accessed via the ZDO_MgmtNwkUpdateNotf_t-status field - for detailed info on
possible status codes see \ref network_notf.
