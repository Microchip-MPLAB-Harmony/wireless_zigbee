# ZCL_StartSecurityReq Function

## C

```c
void ZCL_StartSecurityReq(ZCL_StartSecurityReq_t *req);
```

## Description

 Initializes the KE cluster, discovers KE devices
and performs key establishment

The function should be called in applications supporting the Key Establishment (KE)
cluster, to perform key establishment procedures. The behavior is different on
the trust center and common devices.

On the trust center:

- If the \c remoteAddress field is set to 0, KE cluster will be initialized.

Key establishment will not be performed with any device.

- If \c remoteAddress is set to the extended address of a remote device the

trust center will start key establishment with it.

On a common device:

- If the \c remoteAddress field is set to 0 or to the extended address of the

trust center, the key establishment with the trust center will start.

- Otherwise, the request will eventually fail.


If Certicom Security is not used, the success status is always reported.

Response statuses:
Accessed via the ZCL_StartSecurityConf_t-status field of the
ZCL_StartSecurityReq_t-ZCL_StartSecurityConf callback's argument. 

All possible status codes are wrapped in the -ZCL_SecurityStatus_t enumeration.
