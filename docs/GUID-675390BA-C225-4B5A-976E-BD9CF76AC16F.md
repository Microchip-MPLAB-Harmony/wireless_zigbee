# ZDO_UnbindIndication Function

## C

void ZDO_UnbindIndication(ZDO_UnbindInd_t *unbindInd);
```

## Description

 Indicates that a certain binding has been removed from the local
binding table

The function must be implemented by the application (the body may be left empty).
The function is called by the stack when a ZDP unbinding request initiated either
by a remote device or by the local device is executed (a binding entry is removed).

When the APS_UnbindReq() function is called to remove an entry from the local binding
table the indication function is not called.
