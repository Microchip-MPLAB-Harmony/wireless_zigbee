# CS_GetMemory Function

## C

```c
void CS_GetMemory(CS_MemoryItemId_t memoryId, void **memoryPtr);
```

## Description

 Gets a pointer to the memory allocated for a specific internal structure

\ingroup cs_functions

The function is used to obtain a pointer to the memory identified by a special value. The memory
is allocated by the stack for certain internal buffers and tables. For example, this function can be
employed to get the contents of bidning and routing tables, APS key-pair set, and other tables.

For some of these objects there is the API in BitCloud; the application must use such API rather than
this function to access the contents of a buffer. In case the API is absent the application may use
this function to observe the memory occupied by the buffer but is restricted to use the pointer
obtained with the function to write data to the memory, or the memory may become corrupted.

The function should be provided with an address of a pointer variable which will be assigned to
the starting point of the memory.

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| [in] memoryId | and ID of a parameter or a specific part of the memory |
| [out] memoryPtr | a pointer to which a starting address of the memory is written 

## Returns

 None
